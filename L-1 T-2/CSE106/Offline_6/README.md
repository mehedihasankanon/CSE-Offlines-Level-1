# Offline Assignment on Heaps

The assignment was to implement a custom `Heap` class and use the tester program to compare the performance of the heap operations against the STL `priority_queue`.

## Files

- **heap.h**: Defines the `Heap` class with methods for inserting elements, retrieving the maximum element, deleting the root, and performing heapsort. The heap is implemented as a dynamic array maintaining the complete binary tree property.
- **main.cpp**: A modified tester program that reads numbers from a file (`numbers.txt`), tests insertion and deletion performance of the custom `Heap` class against `priority_queue`, and compares sorting times of heapsort against `std::sort`.
- **makeStress.cpp**: Testing for $10^{7}$ random numbers, script was generated by ChatGPT

## Features

- **Heap Class**: Supports construction from a vector or specified size, insertion, deletion, and max element retrieval while ensuring the heap remains a complete binary tree.
- **Heapsort**: Implements a sorting algorithm using the `Heap` class to sort numbers in descending order.
- **Performance Testing**: Measures and compares the time taken for insertion, deletion, and sorting operations.

## Usage

1. Ensure a `numbers.txt` file exists with one integer per line.
2. Compile and run `main.cpp`:

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o heap_test
   ./heap_test
   ````

3. The program outputs:
   - Time taken for insertions and deletions in both the custom heap and `priority_queue`.
   - Time taken for sorting using heapsort and `std::sort`.
   - Verification of correct sorting (in descending order).
